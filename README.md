# Personal_account_manager

This project is a python implementation of a personal account manager recording details of my day-to-day expenses with a simple UI.

This project requires [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html).

Please note that this is **NOT** an industry-level project. I am just building some projects sufficient for my personal use for fun because I need some entertainment during this tedious and exhausting job-hunting process.
